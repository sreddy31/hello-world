<h2> New Delhi: Former union minister P Chidambaram walked out of Delhi's Tihar jail this evening, hours after being granted bail by the Supreme Court in the INX Media case. As he stepped outside, he was greeted by a group of Congress leaders including his son Karti Chidambaram. Mr Chidambaram said he cannot comment on the case as per Supreme Court's order, but even after spending more than three months in jail, "there is not a single charge framed against me." Mr Chidambaram's first stop after 106 days in prison is Congress president Sonia Gandhi's home. The Congress Rajya Sabha member is also likely to attend parliament tomorrow, Karti said. </h2>
